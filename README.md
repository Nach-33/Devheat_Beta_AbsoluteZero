## How Are Project Solves the Problem Statement
---
People can scan a qr code provided by the restaurant on their table to directly reach the
homepage of the website and place an order accordingly with our website. In a group
everyone can even place a seperate order as we have made it very easy for them to do so
and in that way no one has to calculate the bill split by themselves and instead they just
have to pay for themselves and receive a seperate invoice for each member of the group.
Even if the user doesn't have a device, the admin can place an order from their behalf
using the client side. The admin also has the choice to either print the invoice or just
send the invoice to customer's email id. Overall the restaurant management do not need any
kind of other software or hardware for their billing system.
